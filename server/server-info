We need a simple service where personel can verify a card either by scanning the QR code or entering the 5 digit code manually.
Let's set this up with nginx basic auth:
Username: george
Password: wedding123go

Nice simple and slick UI with the same color theme as the card.
Show the invitee name, whether it is Single or Double.
The spreadsheet could be updated so ideally i want a script to easily copy it to the server to be used as the db. (rsync should work).

SSH Server details:
Username: root
Server IP: 46.62.209.58
No password needed, this PC is allowed via SSH key
Install whatever you need, this server is just for this at the moment. You may remove anything that gets in the way.
