We need to generate invitation cards from blank_invite.png
The spreadsheet wedding_invites.ods contains all the guests.
Here are the columns:
A - Name
B - Single or Double
C - Phone Number (some are missing)
D - Unique code

I suggest we name the cards using the codes and place them in the cards folder.
There is a space to insert the name of the invitee on the card.

A QR code should be placed at the bottom right corner with the word 'SINGLE' or 'DOUBLE' on top of it.

QR code should be a URL (You'll also be building the verification page).
Come up with a URL structure. The server is is 46.62.209.58
