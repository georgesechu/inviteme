we need to send sms as well.
we have a local api we can try

https://www.sms.co.tz/api.php?do=sms&username={username}&password={password}&senderid=SMS.co.tz&dest={msisdn}&msg={message}

where:
username=mitikazinc
password=kpy3!q6j
msisdn=phone number (with 255 without the +)
A simple GET request should work.
