I want to turn this into a fully working web and mobile app called inviteme

Server - Nodejs using TypeScript
WebApp - reactjs using TypeScript
Mobile Apps - react-native using TypeScript

Single repository (monorepo) for all components.
Since typescript is used we should have a large shared codebase (shared by the server web and mobile)

Features:
-Login via a whatsapp code
-Ability to add Guests (Name, Mobile, Single or Double)
-Ability to pick a card design from a gallery
-Ability to share invitation cards (whatsapp) - This is not free and we need a way to charge for this
